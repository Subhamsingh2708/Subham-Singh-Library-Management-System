# Subham-Singh-Library-Management-System
Python Assignment 3


This code defines a Book class to hold book details and a LibraryInventory class to manage a list of books stored in a text file. It provides functions to add books, issue and return them by changing their status, search by title or ISBN, and display all books. The main part of the program is a command-line menu allowing users to perform these actions interactively. The book data is saved and loaded from a text file with each book's details stored as a single line separated by a delimiter.<img width="1425" height="761" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-23 202918" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/052ecb02-b059-4f6d-835a-fab4365cb3ad" />
